# MouseBound

In a multi-monitor setup, restricts the movement of the mouse to the current screen.

Download and extract [MouseBound-v1.0](https://github.com/calin-darie/MouseBound/releases/tag/v1.0)
To auto start MouseBound, create a shortcut for it and add the shortcut to your startup folder.

Hold any ctrl key to temporarily lift the restriction.
Use the tray icon context menu to quit.

You may use it together with the windows setting to show the location of the pointer when ctrl is pressed.
